# TWITTER CATEGORY
Note: As of April ?, 2025. I've decided to remove the declutter section of "Modify Twitter" to make it easier for myself to update these versions. **If you use any of them, you'd wanna install the filter "Simplify Twitter" as well**
## Simplify Twitter
This will remove all of the unnecessary content in here such as:
- All the tweets in "Timeline: explore"
- All the follow suggestions and communities in "Timeline: search"
- "Subscribe", "Who to follow", "Promote" and "Get verified" in "Timeline: posts"
- Post engagements, "Discover more" and all tweets succedding them in "Timeline: conversation"
- Keeps only the tweets in "Timeline: home"
- Post analytics will no longer show the post when you're already inside of it
- "Not followed by anyone you’re following"
- ALL of grok (including the profile summary you'd see inside the hover card)
- Blue notification on new posts
- Views
- Jobs, Premium, Verified Orgs, Grok, Monetization, and Ads button (including the ones inside your settings)
- X icon
- Messages drawer
- Professional Profile in edit your profile
- 3 dots in the account switch button
- Community notes reminder at the very bottom of the post and "Do you find this helpful?"
- "You aren’t verified yet" in profile (this appears occasionally)

Changes the sites look to make it look nicer
