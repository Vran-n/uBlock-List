# QnA
### Will you be updating this periodically?
Yes.
### How would I know you've updated the filters?
You can occasionally check this repository
### How do I update the filters?
Either wait for the auto update to kick in **or** force the update yourself by clicking the tiny clock icon in your filter list beside it
### HELP!!! One of the features are not working!
Ok, that wasnt really a question but, it's either the some part of the site has changed and you just have to wait for an update **or** you're not using uBlockOrigin **or** I've decided to split it into its own addon, which in this case, please refer to the change log.
### Are there any plans for simplying or modifying other sites?
No plans for now.
### Will these filters work in other ad blockers?
There are some exceptions such as AdGuard (though some features wont work), but I **strongly** recommend using this for only uBlockOrigin
### Are you porting this to AdGuard?
Yes, but I'm unsure when.
### Why did you do all of this?
idk honestly. just kinda did it
